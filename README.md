This repository is for the prework assignment (Lab0) for COP4655-001 Fall 2024

In this lab, these goals were accomplished:
- creating a new Xcode project
- adding widgets to the storyboard
- creating names and editing those widgets
- connecting the widgets to the Swift code file as outlets or actions
- connecting an image to the app
- writing in Swift code for the app to work
- creating an alert box

  
Some ideas to improve the app are:

- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Research persistence to learn how to store the information so when app reboots the informatoin remains
- Add more fields to crease a more thorough introduction
